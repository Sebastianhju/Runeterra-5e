# Keystone Runes
> Runes are magical artifacts that are all around Runeterra. There are many kinds of runes of varied rarities; lesser runes, keystone runes and world runes. Keystone runes determine where your power comes from. You can only aquire lesser runes from the same path as your keystone rune. Keystone runes are feats, while lesser runes are magical items that you collect during your adventures.
