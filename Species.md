# Trolls

![](https://github.com/Sebastianhju/Runeterra-5e/blob/main/img-race/Troll.png)
|*Trolls are, for the most part, hulking brutish creatures, found in many of Runeterra’s least hospitable environments. Though not invulnerable, they are blessed with a hardy constitution and the ability to heal more quickly than other mortal races—especially the feeble humans. This means they can endure extremes of climate and scarce resources merely by out-surviving their rivals, and this is the most likely reason some of the largest known tribes still call the mountains of the Freljord home.*|
