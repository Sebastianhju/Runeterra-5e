# Ultimates

Ultimates are very powerfull actions that you obtain during you adventures. You have limited access to using them, so you may spend them wisely. 

Ultimates often comes with a cooldown. Cooldowns go down by one whenever you finish a long rest, or participate in a takedown of a **Greater Foe**.
