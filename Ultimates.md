# Ultimates

Ultimates are very powerfull actions that you obtain during you adventures. You have limited access to using them, so you may spend them wisely. 

Ultimates often comes with a cooldown. Cooldowns go down by one whenever you finish a long rest, or participate in a takedown of a **Greater Foe**.

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 mana to teleport to a location within 30 feet of you (You do not have to see the location). 
When you land, all enemies within 5 feet must make a dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage, halved on a save. After using this bonus action, you can use it again an number of times until you start a long rest. 
For every time you use this action, the mana cost increases and you deal additional acid damage.
