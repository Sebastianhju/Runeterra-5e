## Pre-Timeline: Pre-Runeterra

The Celestial Realm comes to be. Aurelion Sol and similar celestial entities are born with it, and go on to shape the Celestial Realm, creating stars and other cosmic wonders.

Later an unknown group of celestial entities use the World Runes to create the realm of Runeterra. Runeterra is left incomplete, though how, and why, is unknown.

Runeterra exists as two realms: the Material Realm and Spirit Realm. The Material Realm is the physical part of Runeterra, composed of elemental magic and the physical world, while the Spirit Realm is its spiritual counterpart, containing the souls of every one, every thing, every place and every feeling. These two realms mirror each other and affect each other.

Runeterra’s geography shifts with time, leading to the creation of new landmasses.
