# Downtime Activities

Downtime is going to be placed in bulks. Usually the first bulk is going towards leveling up. Then the second or third can be used to do seperate activiteis, or group activites as shown below. 

## Group Activities

Some downtime activities require that the entire party decides decides on the same activity. A single character cannot venture alone on these downtime activities. 

### Go on a side mission

Througout the campaign you might come over missions that are not in the interest of the Noxian millitary. You can travel away during as a part of your training to these missions. Side missions often involve exlusive loot and greater foes.

### Travel to Qualthara or Rockrund

## Solo Activities

### Gambling

During your downtime you can gamble with the other soliders in the millitary camp. 

**Resolution.** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.

The character makes three checks: **Wisdom (Insight)**, **Charisma (Deception)**, and **Charisma (Intimidation)**. If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character did.

**Gambling Results**
|Result|	Value|
|---|---|
|0 successes	|Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount.|
|1 success	|Lose half the money you bet.|
|2 successes|	Gain the amount you bet plus half again more.|
|3 successes|	Gain double the amount you bet.|

**Crafting Magical items**
If you were to craft a magical item it requires time and dedication. First you'll need the nessesary research, spending a downtime bulk to find out how to make the magic item and what resources you'll need to make it. 
You must succeed a dc 20 investegation check. You can spend gold to increase the odds of succeding on this activity. For every hundred gold you spend, the dc is lowered by one. 

If you already have the nessesary research, you can craft the item during the downtime period. The cost of crafting magical items depend on their rarity. 

As you craft the item, you must succed a skill check dependant on the item you are crafting. On a sucess you craft the item. On a faiure, the cost of the item increases by 10% for every number you are lower than the difficulty class due to complications.

### Pit Fighting 

Every weekend the millitary meets up for pit fighting. This also includes gambling and money flowing around. 

**Resolution.** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. A big part of the challenge in pit fighting lies in the unknown nature of a character’s opponents.

The character makes three checks: **Strength (Athletics)**, **Dexterity (Acrobatics)**, and a special **Constitution** check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character’s largest Hit Die (this roll doesn’t spend that die). If desired, the character can replace one of these skill checks with an attack roll using one of the character’s weapons. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Pit Fighting Results table to see how the character did.

**Pit Fighting Results**
|Result	|Value|
|---|---|
|0 successes|	Lose your bouts, earning nothing.|
|1 success|	Win 50 gp.|
|2 successes|	Win 100 gp.|
|3 successes|	Win 200 gp.|
