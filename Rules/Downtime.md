Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

**Resources.** Conducting research requires at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

**Resolution.** The character declares the focus of the research — a specific person, place, or thing. After the downtime bulk, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research Outcomes table.

**Research Outcomes**
|Check Total|	Outcome|
|---|---|
|1–5	|No effect.|
|6–10	|You learn one piece of lore.|
|11–20	|You learn two pieces of lore.|
|21+	|You learn three pieces of lore.|

Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature’s resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

### Relaxation

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don’t want to make use of the downtime system.

When you choose this option, you remove all stacks of exhaustion and gain inspiration.
