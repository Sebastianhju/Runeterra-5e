# Cooldowns

Some items and runes comes with cooldowns. They are often multiplies of 6, as 6 seconds is amount of time a round of combat in D&D takes. 

If you were to reduce a item or runes cooldown by less than 6 second, it still can only trigger once a round, resetting at the start of your turn as with other actions.
