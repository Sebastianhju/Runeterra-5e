## Great Weapon Master

On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

~~Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.~~

**Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.**

## Sharpshooter

Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.

~~Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.~~

**Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.**

## Spell Sniper

When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.

Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, and warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

**Increase your Wisdom, Intelligence or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.**

## Sentinel

When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, **If the creature is no more than one size larger than you** the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.

When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

## Lucky

Please donÂ´t take this, it is boring. 

# Spells
## Magic Missile

Banned, due to its ability to abuse most runes ;D 

# Rulings 
## Flanking

We dont play with the alternative flanking rules. 

## Potions

Taking a potion for yourself requires a bonus action

Feeding somebody else a potion requres an action. 

Elixirs have their own rules in their descriptions

## Summoner Spells

Summoner spells functions as spell scrolls. They are not spells, so they cannot be counterspelled. However, a dispell magic spell or greater restoration could tear off their effects. For the sake of dispell magic, summoner spells count as fifth level spells. 

## Exhaustion

We play with the exhaustion rules from the Unearthed Arcana. Maximum of ten stacks, each stack gives you a -1 modifier to every D20 roll. 

## Getting Downed

Wenever a character gets downed, they gain a stack of exhaustion. 

If a downed creature would take damage, they gain a **Wound**. Wounds are defuss that can vary in degree dependent on the situation they were given in. 

## Resting

You can only long rest at a *Safe Haven* (Dm discretion). Usually this means in a safe tavern or the partys operation base. During travels and dungeoncrawling, short rest will be the only available option. 

|This is to encurage players to be more thoughtfull of their resources. As a DM i often give 1-2 encounters each day, wich makes encounters hard to balance in the first place. Secondly, the mana system gives every spellcaster the oppourtunity to cast their highest level spells at all times, meaning if the characters allways have all resources, they would be conciderably stronger in higher levels. |
